# **About Me**

<img src="/assets/img/me.png" alt="aboutme" style="width:100%;">

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am currently a MSc Student at Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea since 2024.
Im working as a graduate researcher at the [Biorobotics Lab](https://www.biorobotics.snu.ac.kr/), Seoul National University led by Prof. Kyujin Cho. I earned my Bachelor's degree from School of Mechanical Engineering, [Yonsei University](https://me.yonsei.ac.kr/me_en/index.do) at 2024.  

While recent advances have enhanced robotic agility, most systems remain specialized for specific terrains, lacking the versatility to navigate the 3D complexity of the real world.

My research addresses this gap by synthesizing **bio-inspired design with intelligent control**. I focus on developing multi-modal robots that mimic nature’s adaptability—switching between driving, climbing, or perching. Furthermore, I design autonomous control frameworks to fully exploit these physical capabilities, ensuring robust performance in unpredictable, unstructured environments.
